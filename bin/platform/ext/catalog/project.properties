# Determines how ImpEx during importing classification attribute values should behave
# when cannot find such value in the system. By default (false) import line will be marked as
# unresolved and will be treated as pending to allow further import of classification
# attribute value. If this property will be changed to true value will be imported using
# fallback value translator without marking line as unresolved so possible error will be not dumped.
